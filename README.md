# Foraminifera-Image-Segmentation

The code present in this repository segments the chambers of a Foraminifera image from its edge probability map using Markov Random Field based approach. The original probability map is first refined using morphological transformations and Graph-Cut technique is applied later to perform segmentation. The overall covering score obtained is 71.40%.
